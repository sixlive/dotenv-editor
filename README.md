**Note:** Replace ```:author_name``` ```:author_username``` ```:author_email``` ```:package_name``` ```:package_description``` ```:package_space``` ```:author_homepage``` ```:org_username``` ```:org_name``` ```:org_email``` with their correct values in [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
